TO DO ------------------------------------------------------------------------

- False positive count is very high! 1 in 256^(number of files). 
  How can we reduce this?

  - Could use the CRC32 to check passwords, though would need to 
    implement/link in compression algorithms. Very slow, especially for large
    files but reduces fp rate by factor of 2^32.

  - For old versions of PKZIP could rely on non-randomness of initial 12 bytes.
  
  - Similar bugs may be present in other implementations, though it may not
    be worth implementing as user may not know what program/version was used 
    originally.

- Some chosen plain-text statistical attacks are documented online.

- Add more documentation, sort out formatting, boilerplate text etc.

- Add dictionary mode.


Version #1 - July 2012 -------------------------------------------------------

Based on fcrackzip 1.0. See http://oldhome.schmorp.de/marc/fcrackzip.html.

- Rewrote in C++.

- Removed file count limits.

- Removed all assembly.

- Uses multiple CPU cores if present. Single threaded performance roughly the
  same as before refactor.

- Added unit tests.

- Changed build system from autoconf/automake to a simple Python script.
